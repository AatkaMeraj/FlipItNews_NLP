# FlipItNews: News Article Categorization using NLP


🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to automatically classify news articles into categories such as Politics, Technology, Sports, Business, and Entertainment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.

🎯 Objective
✅ Extract and preprocess text data from a company’s internal news database.
✅ Build and compare at least three different models for classification.
✅ Identify the best-performing model for accurate categorization.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
